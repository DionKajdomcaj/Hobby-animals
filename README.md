# Hobby-animals
Hobby animals need several things to preserve their exhilaration. Cathy
has some hobby animals: fishes, birds, and dogs. Every animal has a name and
their exhilaration level is between 0 and 100 (0 means that the animals dies). If
their keeper is in a good mood, she takes care of everything to cheer up her
animals, and their exhilaration level increases: of the fishes by 1, of the birds by
2, and of the dogs by 3. On an ordinary day, Cathy takes care of only the dogs
(their exhilaration level does not change), so the exhilaration level of the rest
decreases: of the fishes by 3, of the birds by 1. On a bad day, every animal
becomes a bit sadder and their exhilaration level decreases: of the fishes by 5,
of the birds by 3, and of the dogs by 10. Cathyâ€™s mood improves by one if the
exhilaration level of every animal is at least 5.
Name the animal of the lowest level of exhilaration which is still alive at the end
of the simulation. If there are more, name all of them!
